Reinforcement Learning had been used to train a model. 

Model.pkl had been trained from this script. 
If you want to test it leave the model.pkl in the script. 
If you want to create the model from the beginning enter another name where model.pkl is written. The code will check if a model in that name had been created  or not. If it is not created the model will start training from the beginning
